MIDDLEWARE

Express is a series of functions each performing a small task.

req->      function->       function->      function->           res->
          (body-parser)


app.use adds piece of middleware to the chain
eg.
app.use(() => {})


app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log("request received at", new Date());
    return next();
})
